# PhpFbGuard
I had nothing to do so me and my friends find something to do, and when one of my friend,
found an interesting python script that enables <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/756130824560105">Facebook Profile Guard</a> feature
and i decided it'd be fun to translate it into php to see how much i can understand python
